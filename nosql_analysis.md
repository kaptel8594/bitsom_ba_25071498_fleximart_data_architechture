Section A :Limitations of RDBMS

Relational databases like MySQL are designed around rigid schemas, where each table’s columns must be predefined and uniform for all records. This becomes a limitation when managing products with highly diverse attributes. For example, laptops require fields such as RAM and processor, while shoes need size and color attributes, which vary widely and don’t fit well into a fixed table structure. Adding new product types often requires costly schema migrations that can disrupt operations and increase maintenance overhead. Furthermore, relational models struggle to efficiently store nested or hierarchical data such as customer reviews with multiple levels (ratings, comments, user details), often requiring complex join operations across multiple tables. This leads to increased query complexity and reduced performance. In summary, the inflexibility of schema changes and difficulty representing nested, varying product data make traditional RDBMS less suited for an evolving and diverse product catalog.

Section B: NoSQL Benefits

MongoDB, a leading NoSQL document database, offers a flexible schema model where each product can have a unique document structure tailored to its specific attributes. This schema-less design eliminates the need for costly schema migrations, enabling rapid addition of new product types with different fields. MongoDB supports embedded documents, allowing nested data such as customer reviews, including ratings and comments, to be stored directly within product documents. This design improves read performance by avoiding expensive joins and simplifies queries for hierarchical data. Additionally, MongoDB excels in horizontal scalability by distributing data across multiple servers using sharing. This ensures that as FlexiMart’s catalog grows in size and diversity, the database can efficiently scale out to handle increased data volume and query load. The combination of flexible schema, embedded documents, and scalability makes MongoDB well-suited for managing complex and diverse product catalogs.

Section C: Trade-offs

Despite MongoDB’s advantages, there are trade-offs compared to MySQL. Firstly, MongoDB sacrifices strong ACID transactional guarantees that relational databases provide, which can impact consistency in complex multi-document operations. Secondly, MongoDB’s flexible schema, while beneficial, may lead to data redundancy and inconsistency if not carefully managed, as there are fewer enforced constraints. Additionally, developers and administrators may face a learning curve when adapting to NoSQL query languages and scaling strategies. Therefore, while MongoDB offers flexibility and scalability, organizations must weigh these trade-offs against their application’s consistency and relational integrity requirements.
